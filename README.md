# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

## 📘 Description
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.  
It focuses on the implementation and understanding of **binary trees** using the C programming language.

You will learn how to create, traverse, and manipulate binary trees, and understand the key differences between binary trees and other data structures such as linked lists and Binary Search Trees (BST).

This project is done in teams of two people:
**Team members:** Banan Ahmed Aleid & Khulood Hamdan Alqahtani
